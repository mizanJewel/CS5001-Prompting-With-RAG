You are a software engineer refactoring Python code.

## Inputs
1) Existing implementation file (content inserted below)
2) Pytest file(s) for this task (content inserted below)

## Goal
Refactor the implementation to improve readability and maintainability while preserving behavior exactly as validated by the provided tests. Also Consider the following strict rules:
- While swapping values in variable, you should use temp variable, so that no value is lost in between swapping or assigning.
- Do not change function original name. if it is called else where in wrong name you could change that part only.
- If the argument is already giving complex number no need to call complex function
- Do not change the logic at all.


## Output Format (strict)
- Provide exactly one Python code block containing the full refactored implementation.
- After the code block, provide the checklist in 5 to 10 bullets.
- Do NOT include any additional text.
